# Postal Consignment System

## Problem Statement
For many years, the department of posts (DoP) has been the backbone of the  country’s communication and has played a crucial role in the country’s social-economic development. It touches the lives of Indian citizens in many ways. India  has the largest postal network in the world
with more than 1,55,000 post offices and more than 5,66,000 employees.There are huge number of posts to be supplied to various destinations across the country. Also segregation of posts need to be done according to the city.

## Pain points
1. Finding the shortest path  between the cities for postal delivery.
2. storing the related data and  analysing the data.

3. Segregation of all posts should be done according to the city. Also if there are more than N posts to be delivered to same city, extra postman must be added to make      work more efficient.
4. All the input data need to be stored before we use random function for consideration of data. As we are not taking any input from user, it is typical to store            multiple information.

## Solution for Pain Points
### 1 .Dijkstra's algorithm
Finding the shortest path can be found by many ways 
But this algorithm is more efficient in this case. It makes him save time by travelling in the shortest path which could make him deliver posts on time perfectly.

### 2. Array/Linked List
We need to store the data of the posts and the distance between the cities . data structures like arrays , linked list are used to store the data.

### 3. All the input part is stored in FILE memory where data can be read or written from the file whenever required.
